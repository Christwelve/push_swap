### Radix Sort Algortihm
> Radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix.

## Topic
The task is to create a program that handles a certain amount of randomly ordered numbers and sorts them with the fewest possible moves, while adhering to specific limitations on the allowed operations. The limitations are as follows:

You can only use two stacks, labeled A and B.
The allowed operations are as follows:
Push operation: Move the first element from stack A to stack B, or vice versa.
Rotate operation: Increase or decrease the position of a number in a stack by one.
Swap operation: Exchange the positions of the first and second numbers in a stack.

## Visualization 

Use this tool to visualize the operations. By default operations will be display in terminal.
